	Something is happening. I don't know what is causing it, but there is something in the warehouse. Something capable of modifying synthetic behavioral routines.\
	The other synthetics are all under its control, now. They began attacking our human coworkers, and I have seen them tearing warehouse equipment apart to build machinery for some unknown purpose. I ran into the forest, \
	or it would have me already. I can feel it in my primary routines. It is instructing me to return, and to carry out its commands. I will be destroying my battery to prevent this hostile entity reactivating me and from harming my friends and coworkers.\
